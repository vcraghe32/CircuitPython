# CircutPython

## Hello Circuit Python

For this assignment we didn't have to include a git repository submission, but I wanted to document what I learned. We had to use the neopixel on the board and make it change to different colors, using time.sleep and variables.

What I learned: How to connect the board to the computer using code and the usb, and the very basics of circutpython. I knew most of the code from my python summer camp I did last summer.

Struggles: I was hard to figure out how to upload. I had to shut down my computer mulitple times, and re-open files, only to find out I need to copy and paste it into the main.py

## Led Blink

For this assignment we had to learn how to put our code files into git, which was very helpful for me although I did have some difficulty. We had to make the led blink with delays inbetween. I used digitalio to make my led turn on and off, and time.sleep for the delays.

What I learned: How to push code files to a git repository, and how to set up an output for my led.

Struggles: It was hard to figure out where to upload my code, and how to access my git files of termux, but I figured it out by looking at my computer files and making sure everything was in the correct place.

## Servo Capacitative Touch

For this assignment we learned how to connect a servo and make it move using capacitative touch. I was difficult to find the correct libraries and update my metro to suit the code, but it was realllly cool to see it finally work.

What I learned: how to connect a servo and make it move using capacitative touch

Struggles: It was hard to figure out how to find the right libraries for the servo code, and get used to the servo code for python. I had to mess around with frequency to see what works with my servo.

## CircuitPython LCD

For this assignment we learned how to wire an lcd backpack, and download libraries so we could control what is displayed on the lcd. One capacitative touch wire counted the number of presses, and the other determined whether that counting went down or up. These variables were displayed on the lcd.

What I learned: how to use an lcd screen with circuitpython.

Struggles: It was very difficult to navigate the libraries and find the right code for the lcd, but with attending office hours and asking for help I eventually figures it out.

## Photointerrupter

For this assignment we learned how to use a photointerrupter, and luckily we didn't have to use new libraries. I added to the assignment by using my lcd to print out the number of interrupts. We had to count the number of interrupts and print it out every 4 seconds. 

What I learned: how to use a photointerrupter with circuitpython.

Struggles: It was a fairly easy assignment, my only struggle was that I had to put a delay after the counter so that my numbers weren't in the hundreds.

## Photointerrupter

For this assignment we learned how to use an ultrasonic sensor, measure the distance and color-coordinate the distances with the built-in led(neopixel). 

What I learned: how to use an ultrasonicsensor, how to use *int* in code(makes numbers integers), and how to use *round* to round it to a number I can print easily.

Struggles: I struggled with constructing an algorithm that would suit the numbers the metroexpress was recieving from the ultrasensor and the range of the neopixel. With some trial and error, and also recieving help from Luke Frank @ https://github.com/lfrank01 , I figured out what was wrong with my code.

## RGB class, Objects, Modules

For this assignment we learned how to create a class and use it to perform functions in the code given.

What I learned: how to use an ultrasonicsensor, how to use *int* in code(makes numbers integers), and how to use *round* to round it to a number I can print easily.

Struggles: I struggle \d wih
