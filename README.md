# CircutPython

## Hello Circuit Python

For this assignment we didn't have to include a git repository submission, but I wanted to document what I learned. We had to use the neopixel on the board and make it change to different colors, using time.sleep and variables.

What I learned: How to connect the board to the computer using code and the usb, and the very basics of circutpython. I knew most of the code from my python summer camp I did last summer.

Struggles: I was hard to figure out how to upload. I had to shut down my computer mulitple times, and re-open files, only to find out I need to copy and paste it into the main.py

## Led Blink

For this assignment we had to learn how to put our code files into git, which was very helpful for me although I did have some difficulty. We had to make the led blink with delays inbetween. I used digitalio to make my led turn on and off, and time.sleep for the delays.

What I learned: How to push code files to a git repository, and how to set up an output for my led.

Struggles: It was hard to figure out where to upload my code, and how to access my git files of termux, but I figured it out by looking at my computer files and making sure everything was in the correct place.
