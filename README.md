# CircutPython

## Hello Circuit Python

For this assignment we didn't have to include a git repository submission, but I wanted to document what I learned. We had to use the neopixel on the board and make it change to different colors, using time.sleep and variables.

What I learned: How to connect the board to the computer using code and the usb, and the very basics of circutpython. I knew most of the code from my python summer camp I did last summer.

Struggles: I was hard to figure out how to upload. I had to shut down my computer mulitple times, and re-open files, only to find out I need to copy and paste it into the main.py

## Led Blink

For this assignment we had to learn how to put our code files into git, which was very helpful for me although I did have some difficulty. We had to make the led blink with delays inbetween. I used digitalio to make my led turn on and off, and time.sleep for the delays.

What I learned: How to push code files to a git repository, and how to set up an output for my led.

Struggles: It was hard to figure out where to upload my code, and how to access my git files of termux, but I figured it out by looking at my computer files and making sure everything was in the correct place.

## Servo Capacitative Touch

For this assignment we learned how to connect a servo and make it move using capacitative touch. I was difficult to find the correct libraries and update my metro to suit the code, but it was realllly cool to see it finally work.

What I learned: how to connect a servo and make it move using capacitative touch

Struggles: It was hard to figure out how to find the right libraries for the servo code, and get used to the servo code for python. I had to mess around with frequency to see what works with my servo.
